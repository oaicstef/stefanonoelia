                    <h3>03 May: He saw Her</h3>
                    <p>Mark and Sarah crossed paths multiple times in college, but it wasn't until after Mark graduated that
                        they met through mutual friends from Oregon State University. The first night they officially met
                        was at Kell's Irish Pub, downtown Portland.
                    </p>
                    <p>Mark spotted Sarah and asked their mutual friend Tom about her. At the end of the night, Tom insisted
                        that Mark and Sarah talk on the phone, so he called Sarah, handed Mark the phone, and the rest is
                        history...</p>

                    <p>Mark took Sarah to Thirst Wine Bar on the Willamette River for their first date in June of 2014, just
                        before Sahra went back to OSU for her last year of school. </p>
                    <p>After dinner and drinks, they decided to walk the docks on the Portland Waterfront, but Sarah couldn't
                        even imagine what awaited her. Mark had also planned a romantic boat trip that turned out to be one
                        of the most fun and unforgettable moments of their lives.</p>

                    <h3>28 June: The First Kiss</h3>
                    <p>Mark was extremely nervous. He was afraid to expose his feelings to sarah, but didnâ€™t want to risk staying
                        in the friend zone. So it was now or never! After all, Sarah was the one. After a pleasant walk in
                        the park, it was time to say goodbye. Just as she started to walk away from him, he grabbed her waist
                        and pulled her close. Then, he kissed her with passion. "It was about time!" she said. It was...PERFECT!</p>

                    <p>They had taken overnight trips before, but this was their first huge vacations outside the USA. Sarah
                        and Mark travelled to the Baltic region and visited a number of countries including Iceland, Finland,
                        Denmark, Russia, Poland and Germany . It was a 24 day fabulous trip! It was super intense but so
                        rewarding for both. </p>

                    <h3>14 April: They moved together</h3>
                    <p>Just a year after they met, Mark and Sarah finally decided to move in together. Although it seemed a
                        hasty decision, they thought it made perfect sense at that point in their lives. </p>
                    <p>Due to Sarah's work, which required some schedule flexibility, it began to be increasingly difficult
                        for them to be with one another. It was at this momment that both realized they needed (more than
                        ever), the support and comfort that only they could give each other.</p>
                    <p>With the help of their families, they moved forward with this important decision and bought their first
                        home together. And I must add that ... it was the best decision they ever made!</p>

                        their way down to dinner with the Ship's Captain, Mark's nerves got the best of him and he pulled
                        Sarah back to the room and straight onto the balcony for the best proposal a girl could ask for!</p>
